Using the AnimationRegistry.cs and PokeSprite.cs, the project can now load any sprite taken from https://sprites.pmdcollab.org/

As long as the sprites and AnimData.xml files are in folder "res:.//sprite/", the PokeSprites class will initialize an AnimationRegistry and load sprites based on information from that registry. 

To add or remove sprites that should be loaded, go to AnimationRegistry.Init()
